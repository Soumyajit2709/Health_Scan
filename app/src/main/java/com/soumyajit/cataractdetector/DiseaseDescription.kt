    val eye_info = "Cataract refers to the clouding of the lens inside the eye, leading to a decrease in vision. Cataracts typically develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may include faded or blurred vision, making tasks like driving, reading, or recognizing faces challenging. Vision impairment caused by cataracts can also increase the risk of falls and depression. Cataracts account for half of all blindness cases worldwide and 33% of visual impairments.\n\n" +
            "Cataracts are most commonly caused by aging, but they can also result from injury, radiation exposure, congenital conditions, or occur after eye surgery. Risk factors include diabetes, smoking, prolonged sunlight exposure, and alcohol consumption. The underlying mechanisms involve the accumulation of protein or brownish-colored pigment clumps in the lens, reducing the transmission of light to the back of the eye's retina. Diagnosis is made through an eye examination."
