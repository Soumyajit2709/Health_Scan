# Health Scan : Android App for Detecting Cataract from Eye Image

"Health Scan" is a groundbreaking Android application that harnesses the power of technology to make cataract detection accessible and user-friendly. By using a sophisticated tech stack that includes Java, Kotlin, XML, Android, and Tensorflow Lite, this project achieves a remarkable 92% accuracy rate in cataract detection. The app allows users to self-assess their eye health by capturing images through their device's camera, instantly detecting cataract and normal eye conditions.

Key Achievements:

MedNet Model Development:
This project involved the development of a MedNet model, a neural network tailored for medical image analysis. The model was meticulously trained using a comprehensive dataset of cataract eye images. Through rigorous fine-tuning, it achieved an exceptional accuracy rate of 92%, ensuring precise cataract detection.

Tensorflow Lite Integration:
The fine-tuned MedNet model was seamlessly integrated into the Android application using Tensorflow Lite. This integration is a testament to the team's technical prowess and dedication. It enables real-time detection of cataract and normal eye conditions from images captured by the device's camera.
